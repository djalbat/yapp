# Yapp

Yet Another Pretty Printer.

*Please note that Yapp is currently in alpha, as the grammars are still under development. There is also a short wait for the package name to become available on npm.*

*If you are interested in contributing to Yapp, in particular to its grammars, please see the contribution section below.*

## Installation

*Please note that Yapp is not currently available as an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packge, it can only be cloned.*

You can clone the repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com/)...

    git clone https://github.com/djalbat/yapp.git

...and then install the dependencies with npm from within the project's root directory:

    npm install

You will need to do this if you want to look at the examples.
