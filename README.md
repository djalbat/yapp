# Yapp

Yet Another Pretty Printer.

*Please note that Yapp is currently in beta, as the grammars are still under development. There is also a short wait for the package name to become available. If you are interested in contributing to Yapp, in particular to its grammars, see the contribution section below.*

Yapp is a fully fledged pretty printer, meant for code listings, that can also double as a simple code editor. It has advanced functionality to not only tokenise and parse code, but also to post-process the parse tree. This allows for a degree of refinement in syntax highlighting that rivals commercial editors.

## Installation

*Again please note that Yapp is not currently available as an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packge, it can only be cloned.*

You can clone the repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com/)...

    git clone https://github.com/djalbat/yapp.git

...and then install the dependencies with npm from within the project's root directory:

    npm install

You will need to do this if you want to look at the examples.
